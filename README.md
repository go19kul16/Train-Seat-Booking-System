This is a simple Angular application designed to simulate a train seat booking system. The system allows users to book seats in a train coach that contains 80 seats, arranged in rows with a specific layout. Users can book up to 7 seats at a time, with priority given to booking seats in the same row.

## Features

- **Seat Layout**: The coach contains 11 rows with 7 seats each, except for the last row, which contains 3 seats.
- **Booking System**: Users can book 1 to 7 seats. The system attempts to book seats in a single row first; if not possible, it books the nearest available seats.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive interface with vibrant colors and responsive design elements to enhance user experience.
- **Real-Time Availability**: Seat availability is displayed in real-time, with booked seats highlighted.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: The framework used to build the application.
- **TypeScript**: The programming language used to write the application logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
